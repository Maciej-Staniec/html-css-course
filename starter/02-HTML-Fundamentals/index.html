      <!-- Notice that the img element doesn't have opening and closing tags. So, how do we specify its content? Well, we have to include some attributes within the tag to describe the element's content. The most common attributes of img element is src and alt. The src attribute allows us to specify the path to the image and the alt allows us to specify the text which will show if the image couldn't be loaded on our webpage. -->

      <!-- We could use a <b> tag to make text bold, but since HTML5, we use a <strong> tag.
      What is the difference? The <b> tag doesn't have any "semantic" meaning unlike the <strong> tag. the <strong> tag says to the browser that something is a very imprtant element that we want to stand out from the page. -->

      All modern websites and web applications are built using three
      <em>fundamental</em>
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web.
      <!-- The same rule applies to the <i> tag, which makes text italic, but doesn't have 'semantic' meaning. Instead, we use <em> which stands for emphasize. -->
    </p>
    <p>
      In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
      and why you too should learn it.
    </p>
    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
      <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language
      that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage
      (not a programming language).
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
    <ol>
      <!-- 
      ol stands for ordered list
      to see the actual numbered list, we need to create list items inside the ordered list element. In this case ol element is the parent of li elements and li elements are children of the ol element.
      -->
      <li>The opening tag</li>
      <!-- li stands for list item -->
      <li>The closing tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You can learn more at
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
        target="_blank"
        >MDN Web Docs.</a
      >
      <!-- The 'a' element stands for anchor element. It is equivalent to a hyperlink or URL link. The 'href' attribute allows us to specify the hyperlink value. The 'target' attribute with the '_blank' value allows us to open the hyperlink in a new browser tab.-->
    </p>

    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the
      web. Here are 5 of them:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <!-- ul stands for an unordered list or bullet point list. This element tells the browser that any list item within its opening and closing tags we want to be rendered as a bullet point.-->
      <!-- As you probably noticed, each list requires creating list items that is li elements within the ul element, and each li item holds text between opening and closing tags. -->
      <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
      <li>
        To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
        Worpress or Wix
      </li>
      <li>To build web applications To impress friends</li>
      <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
